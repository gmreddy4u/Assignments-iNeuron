# 1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

""" This code also works but will leave us comma at the end of the result. So using the list
for i in range(2000, 3200+1):
  if i%7 == 0:
    if i%5 == 0:
      continue
    print (i, end = ', ')"""


#define a list
m = []
#using for loop and using +1 to include 3200 in the range
for i in range(2000, 3200+1):
  if i%7 == 0:
    if i%5 == 0:
      continue
    m.append(i)

for j in range(0, len(m)):
  if(j<len(m)-1):
    print (m[j], end = ', ')
  else:
    print (m[j])


# 2. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

#Variable a to take input of user first name
a = input ("Enter your first name:")
#Variable a to take input of user last name
b = input ("Enter your Last Name:")

#Printing user first name and last name in reverse order with a space inbetween
print (a[::-1] + ' ' + b[::-1])


# 3. Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.

# Importing math library to use pi
import math

# Diameter is 2r
# Variable a to take input of diameter of a sphere
a = input("Enter diameter of a Sphere:")
# formula V = (4/3)*pi*(r*r*r) #r cube
v=(4/3)*math.pi*(int(a)/2)**3
# Printing volume of the Sphere
print("Volume of the Sphere is:" + str(v))
